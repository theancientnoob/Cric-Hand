**CRIC-HAND(still working on the name)**
this is my latest python project( as you could see with the code).
it is made after the childhood game that we all used to play - hand cricket!
well, i thought that sooner or later im going to forget everything about my childhood so i decided to make this game
so that i could atleast remember something.
